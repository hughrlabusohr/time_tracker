# Time Tracking App

## Description

In this assignment, the objective was to wrestle a Rails application into submission over the course of several days / phases.

In undertaking this assignment, we were to reflect on gaps in knowledge and areas of weakness that we will need to shore up before our time at The Iron Yard is up.

The application built for this assignment was a time tracking application for a software development company that would keep track of ongoing projects and tally up the hours logged working on the various projects by the developers working at this company.
